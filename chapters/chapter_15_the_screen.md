**Chapter 15: THE SCREEN**

The modem screamed first—a high-pitched digital shriek that tore through the quiet of the suburban living room, followed by the chittering handshake, the static hiss of connection. Maria Rodriguez watched the screen glow blue in the dark, her fingers resting on the warm plastic of the keyboard. Outside, the California night was silent except for the distant hum of the freeway. Inside, the computer whirred like a living thing, breathing light into her face.

She was seventeen, and the year was 1996. The screen showed a chat room called "Global Village." Names scrolled by: TokyoTom, ParisGirl, MoscowMike. Maria typed: "Hello from Los Angeles." The response came seconds later from someone in Berlin: "What time is it there?" She looked at the clock on the wall—11:47 PM. "Almost midnight," she typed back. "Here it is morning," Berlin replied. "The sun is just coming up."

Maria felt it then, the strange compression of the world. Her father was asleep in the next room, a man who had crossed a literal border with nothing but the clothes on his back. He had walked through desert, hidden in truck beds, paid coyotes with money borrowed from cousins. His journey had taken weeks, had been measured in blisters and thirst. Maria had crossed a border in seven seconds, the time it took for her words to reach Germany.

The screen flickered. A private message appeared from someone called "FactoryGirl." "I work in Shenzhen," the message said. "Making computer parts. Do you know where that is?" Maria didn't. She went to the bookshelf, pulled down the atlas her father kept for when he dreamed of returning to Mexico. She found China, traced the coast with her finger until she found Shenzhen. A dot. A city she had never heard of, making the parts for the machine she was using.

"What do you make?" Maria typed.

"Circuit boards. For computers like yours."

"How old are you?"

"Sixteen."

The same age. Maria looked at her hands, then at the keyboard. Somewhere across the ocean, a girl her age had touched this plastic, had soldered these circuits. The distance between them was both infinite and nonexistent. Maria's father had taught her that borders were real things—fences, rivers, checkpoints. But here was a border that was only light, only information, and she was on both sides at once.

The modem screamed again as she disconnected. The screen went black, reflecting her face back at her—a brown girl in a Los Angeles suburb, connected to a Chinese factory girl through silicon and copper wire. She placed her palm against the warm monitor, feeling the faint vibration of the cathode ray tube. Somewhere in that machine was the heat of another girl's hands.

The call center in Bangalore hummed with a low, constant murmur—a hundred voices speaking English with Indian accents, a hundred headsets glowing under fluorescent lights. Arjun Patel adjusted his headset for the third time that hour. The foam ear cushions were damp with sweat. On his screen, a script scrolled: "Thank you for calling TechSupport USA. My name is John. How may I help you today?"

The voice in his ear was angry, American, male. "My internet's down again. This is the third time this week."

"I understand your frustration, sir," Arjun said, his voice carefully neutral, the accent practiced for months. "Let me check your connection. Can you tell me what lights are blinking on your modem?"

He could picture the man—probably in a suburban home, probably frustrated after a long day at work. Arjun was in a concrete building in Bangalore, the night outside thick with heat and the smell of street food. His shift started at 8 PM and would end at 4 AM, matching the daylight hours of the customers he served. He was a ghost in their machines, a voice with a fake name solving problems they couldn't be bothered to learn.

"All the lights are off," the American said. "It's just dead."

"Have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in?"

A sigh through the headset. "Of course I tried that. Do you think I'm an idiot?"

Arjun closed his eyes. He thought of his mother, who still cooked on a clay stove, who had never touched a computer. He thought of the American's mother, who probably had a kitchen full of appliances that beeped and blinked. The distance between them was not just geography but time—centuries compressed into a single phone line.

"Let me walk you through a diagnostic," Arjun said, pulling up the script on his screen. "First, I need you to locate the reset button..."

As he spoke, he watched the other operators in the room. Young men and women, most from families like his—educated but poor, chasing the promise of the new economy. They wore Western clothes, drank Coca-Cola, spoke American English. But at the end of their shifts, they went home to houses where their grandparents spoke languages that had no words for "modem" or "bandwidth."

The call ended after forty-seven minutes. The American's internet was working again. He didn't thank Arjun, just grunted and hung up. Arjun removed his headset, the indentations in his hair feeling like a brand. He looked at his screen, at the queue of waiting calls. Ninety-three people needed help. Ninety-three frustrations waiting to travel through fiber-optic cables across oceans and time zones.

His supervisor walked by, placing a hand on his shoulder. "Good call time, John. Keep it up."

Arjun didn't correct him. He was John for eight hours a day, five days a week. He was Arjun the rest of the time, but he was starting to forget which one was real. He put the headset back on, clicked "Next Call." A woman's voice, tired, from Ohio. "My email isn't working..."

He became a voice again, a script, a solution. Outside the window, Bangalore slept and woke in cycles that had nothing to do with the sun on the other side of the world. The city was becoming something new—a place that lived on global time, that never fully slept because somewhere, always, it was business hours.

The shipping container smelled of sweat, diesel, and the sharp chemical scent of new plastic. Chen Wei worked in rhythm with the other women—reach, grab, place, seal. Reach, grab, place, seal. The toys moved down the conveyor belt: action figures with exaggerated muscles, bright colors, smiling faces. Her job was to place them in boxes, then seal the boxes with tape.

The factory in Shenzhen was a city within a city—a vast concrete structure where thirty thousand people made things for the world. Chen Wei had come from a village where her family grew rice. Here, she made plastic toys that would end up under Christmas trees in America. She had seen pictures of those trees—tall, decorated with lights, surrounded by wrapped presents. She tried to imagine the children who would play with these toys, but their faces wouldn't come. They were just ideas, ghosts at the end of the production line.

The foreman walked by, his shoes clicking on the concrete. He didn't look at the workers, just at the production numbers on his clipboard. "Faster," he said to no one in particular. "We're behind quota."

Chen Wei's fingers moved faster. Reach, grab, place, seal. The action figures had movable limbs, detailed costumes, weapons that snapped into their hands. She wondered what stories they were part of, what battles they fought in the imaginations of children she would never meet. Each toy was a little piece of story, manufactured here, shipped there, played with somewhere else.

At the break, she sat with the other women in the cafeteria. They ate rice and vegetables from metal bowls. No one spoke much. The work was monotonous, the hours long, but the money was more than they could make back home. Chen Wei sent half her wages to her parents in the village. With the other half, she was saving for a computer.

She had seen computers in the city—in internet cafes where young people played games and talked to strangers from other countries. She wanted to see what the world looked like from the other side of the toys she made. She wanted to know if the children who played with them were happy, if the toys brought them joy or if they were just more things in rooms already full of things.

The whistle blew. Back to work. Reach, grab, place, seal. The conveyor belt never stopped. It was like a river, carrying plastic downstream to somewhere she couldn't see. Chen Wei's hands ached—a deep, persistent ache in the joints of her fingers. She looked at them, at the small cuts from the plastic edges, at the tape adhesive that never fully washed off. These hands made toys. These hands touched the things that would be touched by children halfway around the world.

She thought about connection. Her village was connected to the land—to the rice paddies, to the seasons, to generations of ancestors buried in the hills. Here, she was connected to a global machine, a network of production and consumption that spanned continents. She was a node in a circuit, a worker in a chain that ended in living rooms she could barely imagine.

At the end of her shift, fourteen hours after it began, she walked back to the dormitory. The city around the factory was a frenzy of construction—new buildings going up every week, roads being paved, neon signs blinking in characters she could read and English she couldn't. Shenzhen was becoming something, growing at a speed that felt unnatural. It was a city being born fully formed from the needs of the connected world.

In her bunk, Chen Wei took out her notebook. She kept a record of the toys she packed. Today: 1,247 action figures. Yesterday: 1,189. The numbers were meaningless except as measure of time passing. She closed her eyes and tried to picture where they all went. A map in her mind, with lines radiating out from Shenzhen to ports, to stores, to homes. A web of plastic and cardboard connecting her to people she would never know.

The classroom in rural Kansas was quiet except for the hum of the computers along the wall. Ten machines, donated by a tech company, each with a bright monitor and a mouse that felt alien in the hands of the children. Mr. Johnson, the teacher, stood at the front of the room. He was sixty years old and had taught in this school for thirty-five of them. He remembered when the biggest technological advancement was the electric pencil sharpener.

"Today," he said, "we're going to talk to someone in Japan."

The children—twelve of them, grades six through eight combined—looked at him with skepticism. Japan was a place in textbooks, in movies about Godzilla and samurai. It wasn't a place you talked to.

Mr. Johnson had attended a workshop over the summer. They called it "The Global Classroom Initiative." He had learned about video conferencing, about chat rooms, about email pen pals. The idea was to connect rural American children with the world, to prepare them for a future that was already happening elsewhere.

He turned on the computer, clicked through menus. The screen showed a test pattern, then flickered to life. A face appeared—a Japanese teacher in a classroom that looked both familiar and strange. The children in Japan wore uniforms. Their classroom had posters with characters Mr. Johnson didn't recognize.

"Hello from Kansas," Mr. Johnson said, feeling foolish talking to a screen.

"Hello from Tokyo," the Japanese teacher replied. Her English was careful, precise.

The children stared. They had seen faces on TV, but this was different. This face was talking to them, right now, live. The delay was slight—just enough to make the conversation feel unreal, like talking through water.

The Japanese teacher introduced her students. They bowed. The Kansas children waved awkwardly. Then the questions began, translated by the teachers.

"What do you eat for lunch?"

"Do you have cows?"

"What games do you play?"

The answers came back across the ocean, through satellites or cables, Mr. Johnson wasn't sure which. The Japanese children ate rice and fish for lunch. They didn't have cows in Tokyo. They played video games and baseball.

Billy, a farm boy with calloused hands from helping his father with the harvest, raised his hand. "Can I ask something?"

Mr. Johnson nodded.

Billy leaned toward the screen. "Do you know where your food comes from?"

The question was translated. The Japanese children looked confused. One of them answered: "From the store."

Billy sat back, a strange expression on his face. He knew where food came from—from the earth, from labor, from weather and luck. He knew the smell of turned soil, the weight of a bushel of wheat, the sound of corn growing in the summer heat. The idea that food came "from the store" was as alien to him as Tokyo was.

The video call lasted twenty minutes. When it ended, the screen went back to the test pattern. The classroom was quiet. The children were processing something they didn't have words for.

Mr. Johnson looked at their faces—these children of farmers and mechanics, of people who worked with their hands in a world that was increasingly about working with information. He wondered what he had just shown them. A window to a wider world, yes. But also a mirror that showed them how small their own world was, how specific, how fragile.

After school, Billy stayed behind. "Mr. Johnson?"

"Yes, Billy?"

"That was... weird."

"It was different."

"My dad says the internet's a fad. Like CB radios."

Mr. Johnson smiled. "Maybe. Or maybe it's something else."

Billy looked at the computer, now dark and silent. "Those kids... they don't know where food comes from. But they know how to talk to us from the other side of the world. That seems backwards."

"Different kinds of knowing," Mr. Johnson said, though he wasn't sure he believed it.

He locked up the school and walked to his car. The Kansas sky was huge, endless, the kind of sky that made you feel small in a way that was comforting. The horizon was a straight line between land and air, unbroken by mountains or ocean. It was a sky that promised nothing but more of the same—more wheat, more corn, more seasons turning.

But in his classroom, he had just seen a different kind of horizon—one made of light and information, one that curved around the planet. He didn't know which sky his students would grow up under. Maybe both. Maybe neither.

The earthquake hit at 2:46 PM local time. In California, it was 10:46 PM the previous night. Maria Rodriguez was asleep when the news started appearing on the early internet forums. She woke to the sound of her father's radio in the kitchen, the Spanish-language news reporting something about Asia.

She went to the computer, dialed up. The connection was slow—the networks were clogged with traffic. When she finally got through, the first images loaded in fragments: collapsed buildings, dust clouds, people running. Japan. An earthquake offshore, a tsunami warning.

She refreshed the page. More images. A forum thread titled "Kobe Earthquake Updates" was growing by the minute. People from around the world were posting—some with information, some with prayers, some just witnessing. Maria scrolled through, her heart beating faster. The world was breaking somewhere, and she was watching it happen in real time, from her bedroom.

She thought of the video call from school, the Japanese children in their uniforms. Were they safe? Were they in Kobe? She had no way to know. The connection that had felt so magical, so futuristic, now felt useless. She could see the disaster but couldn't touch it, couldn't help.

Her father came into the room. "What are you looking at?"

"An earthquake in Japan. A big one."

He stood behind her, watching the screen. He had lived through earthquakes in Mexico, had felt the ground become liquid, had seen adobe houses collapse like sandcastles. He crossed himself. "Dios mío."

On screen, a user from Australia posted: "My brother is in Kobe for business. Can't reach him. If anyone has information..." An address followed. Someone from Singapore replied: "I have a friend at the embassy. Will try to find out."

Maria watched as strangers coordinated across time zones, sharing information, offering help. It was messy, chaotic, full of misinformation and repetition. But it was also something new—a global response happening at the speed of light, not the speed of governments or news organizations.

She thought of the factory girl in Shenzhen. Was she watching this too? Was she in a internet cafe somewhere, seeing the same images, feeling the same helplessness? The connection between them felt different now—not just about toys or computers, but about being human in a world where disaster could be witnessed but not prevented.

Her father placed a hand on her shoulder. "The world is getting smaller," he said in Spanish.

"Or bigger," Maria replied. "I can see more of it breaking."

She stayed at the computer for hours, refreshing, reading, watching. The sun came up outside, but on the screen, it was still night in Japan. The images kept coming—rescue workers digging through rubble, lines of people waiting for water, cars tossed like toys by the tsunami that had followed the quake.

At school that day, everyone was talking about it. Mr. Johnson had set up a computer in the library showing news feeds. Children gathered around, silent, watching a world they were connected to but couldn't touch. Billy, the farm boy, looked at the images of collapsed highways and said, "They build different than us."

It was true. The concrete, the architecture, the scale—all different. But the faces of the people digging through rubble, the tears, the dust-covered clothes—those were the same.

Maria went to the library during lunch. She found the email address for the school in Tokyo they had video-called. She wrote a message: "We saw the news. We are thinking of you. Are you safe?" She didn't know if anyone would read it, if the school even had power, if the teachers were alive or dead. She sent it anyway.

The reply came three days later. A short message from the Japanese teacher: "We are in Tokyo. We are safe. Thank you for your concern. Some of our students have family in Kobe. We are waiting for news."

Maria printed the email, held the paper in her hands. The words had traveled from Tokyo to Kansas to Los Angeles, through cables under oceans, through servers in unknown locations. They were just electrons rearranged, but they carried weight, meaning, human concern across distance.

She showed it to her father. He read it slowly, his lips moving as he sounded out the English. "So you can talk to them," he said. "Just like that."

"Just like that."

He shook his head. "When I was your age, if someone in Japan had an earthquake, we might read about it in the newspaper a week later. If we were lucky."

Maria looked at the email again. The time stamp showed when it was sent, when it was received. The gap was minutes, not weeks. The world had accelerated, and she was living in the new
