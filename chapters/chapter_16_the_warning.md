# Chapter 16: THE WARNING

## Scene 1: The Last Summer

The cicadas screamed in the Georgia pines, a sound like tearing metal that filled the air from dawn until the blood-red sun dipped below the horizon. Sergeant Marcus Chen wiped sweat from his brow, the salt stinging his eyes as he watched the convoy of National Guard trucks roll through the gates of Fort Stewart. They weren't carrying soldiers to war zones overseas anymore. They were carrying water to Atlanta.

His daughter, Lily, sat on the porch steps beside him, her small fingers tracing patterns in the dust. At seven years old, she already understood the rhythm of rationing: blue days for water, red days for power, yellow days when the air quality warnings kept everyone indoors. The air today smelled of ozone and something else—the faint, sweet rot of dying vegetation.

"Dad," she said without looking up, "why do the trees look like that?"

He followed her gaze to the line of loblolly pines along the fence. Their needles were brown at the tips, a slow creep of death working its way down each branch. The bark showed strange lesions, weeping a dark sap that attracted clouds of black flies.

"Something's wrong with the soil," he said, keeping his voice even. "The pH balance changed. Too much acid rain."

She nodded as if this made perfect sense. Children of the 2020s accepted environmental collapse with the same matter-of-factness that earlier generations accepted thunderstorms. The world was ending, but there were still math worksheets to complete, still cartoons to watch during the two-hour evening power window.

Inside the house, Marcus's wife Elena was canning tomatoes from their struggling garden. The kitchen steamed with the pressure cooker's hiss, the scent of basil and vinegar cutting through the heat. She worked with the focused intensity of someone preserving not just food, but memory—the taste of summer, the color red, the simple pleasure of something grown in earth.

"Another convoy heading north?" she asked without turning from her work.

"Third this week. The Chattahoochee's at fifteen percent capacity. They're talking about tapping the Tennessee River system."

Elena's hands stilled for a moment. "That's interstate water. That's war talk."

Marcus didn't answer. He'd seen the briefing maps: blue lines representing rivers growing thinner each year, red zones where aquifers had collapsed, yellow warnings for regions where the water table had dropped below what pumps could reach. The military was no longer preparing for foreign invasions but for domestic resource wars. They trained for crowd control at water distribution points, for securing infrastructure against sabotage, for managing refugee flows from coastal cities.

Lily came inside, her bare feet leaving dusty prints on the linoleum. "Mom, can I help?"

Elena handed her a jar of sterilized lids. "Count them for me. We need twenty-four."

The simple ritual—counting, stacking, organizing—felt like prayer. In a world coming apart at the seams, they clung to order: jars lined up neatly on shelves, schedules followed, routines maintained. The chaos was outside, in the failing ecosystems, the collapsing supply chains, the political fractures. Inside their home, they built a fortress of normalcy.

That night, as Marcus lay awake listening to the distant rumble of generators, he thought about his grandfather who had fought in Vietnam, his father who had served in Desert Storm. They had faced human enemies with human motivations. Marcus faced an enemy without malice or strategy—a changing atmosphere, a warming ocean, a planet shifting into a new equilibrium that excluded the civilization built upon the old one.

The warning had been there for decades, of course. Scientists had drawn the graphs, activists had marched, politicians had made speeches. But warnings require the capacity to be warned, and humanity had proven itself uniquely unwarnable. The problem was too big, too slow, too abstract until it wasn't. Until the reservoirs dried up. Until the crops failed. Until the storms came with names and body counts.

He drifted into a fitful sleep and dreamed of water—clear, cold, abundant. He woke with a start at 3 AM to the sound of rain on the roof. For a glorious moment, he thought the drought had broken. Then he smelled it: the acrid tang of chemical runoff carried on acid rain, washing the last nutrients from their garden's soil.

## Scene 2: The Field Hospital

Dr. Anika Sharma's hands moved automatically through the decontamination protocol: scrub, rinse, repeat. The water in the surgical sink ran brown with Georgia clay, then clear, then brown again as the filtration system struggled. Outside the makeshift field hospital—a repurposed high school gymnasium in Macon—the line of patients stretched around the block.

The new pathogen didn't have an official name yet. The CDC called it "Respiratory Syncytial Variant Gamma," but the nurses called it "Dust Lung" because of how it started: a dry cough that progressed to a rattling, particulate-filled hack. It thrived in arid conditions, spreading through dust clouds kicked up by drought-stricken fields and construction sites. The particulates carried fungal spores that colonized compromised lung tissue.

Anika moved to Bed 14, where a farmworker named Javier Ramirez struggled to breathe. His oxygen saturation read 82%, dangerously low. His skin had the grayish pallor of someone whose blood couldn't carry enough oxygen.

"Javier," she said, placing a hand on his shoulder. "We're going to try a different mask. It will help."

He nodded weakly, his eyes wide with the particular terror of suffocation. Anika adjusted the high-flow nasal cannula, increasing the oxygen concentration. The machine hummed, a sound that filled the ward alongside the chorus of coughs, beeping monitors, and whispered prayers.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket. A text from her brother in Mumbai: "Monsoon failed again. Heat wave hitting 48C. Mother in hospital with heat stroke. Send money if you can."

She closed her eyes for a moment, the dual burdens of professional and familial responsibility pressing down. Anika had come to America for her residency, stayed for a fellowship, and now found herself trapped in a collapsing system, sending remittances home to another collapsing system. The pandemic had revealed the fragility of global supply chains; the climate crisis was revealing the fragility of everything else.

"Nurse!" she called. "I need a sputum culture kit for Bed 22."

A young nurse named Chloe hurried over, her face mask smudged with exhaustion. "We're out of the sterile containers. Supply truck got delayed by flash floods in Tennessee."

"Use what we have. Improvise."

Chloe nodded, her eyes showing the thousand-yard stare of someone who had been working eighteen-hour shifts for weeks. The hospital staff were running on caffeine and desperation, their own immune systems compromised by stress and sleep deprivation.

Anika moved down the row of beds, making notes on a tablet. Bed 18: elderly woman with comorbid asthma, not responding to treatment. Bed 21: construction worker, early 40s, previously healthy, now on ventilator. Bed 24: child, age 9, parents hovering anxiously.

She knelt beside the child's bed. "Hi, Maya. How's your breathing today?"

The girl held up a finger: a little worse. Anika listened to her lungs through the stethoscope. The crackles were more pronounced than yesterday, the wheeze tighter. The disease progressed differently in children—faster, more vicious.

"Your mom tells me you like to draw," Anika said, pulling a fresh sheet of paper from her pocket. "I brought you some paper."

Maya's eyes brightened. She took the paper and a pencil from the bedside table and began to sketch. Anika watched as a house emerged, then trees, then a sun with a smiling face. Normalcy, remembered and reconstructed.

In the staff break room later, Anika scrolled through the latest epidemiological reports. Dust Lung had been identified in twelve states now, following the drought patterns. The mortality rate for patients over 60 was 34%. For children under 10, it was 18% and climbing. The pharmaceutical companies were racing to develop vaccines, but the virus kept mutating, adapting to the new environmental conditions that favored its spread.

Chloe slumped into the chair beside her. "They're talking about setting up tents in the parking lot. We're at 150% capacity."

"Where are they getting the tents?"

"FEMA. Same place we're getting the body bags."

Anika rubbed her temples. The math was simple and brutal: more drought meant more dust meant more disease meant more deaths. The feedback loops were tightening, each crisis amplifying the others. The pandemic of the 2020s had been a warning shot across the bow; this was the broadside.

Her phone buzzed again. Another text from Mumbai: "Mother stable but needs medication. Pharmacy out of stock. Can you send?"

She calculated the time difference, the wire transfer fees, the conversion rates. The simple act of helping her family required navigating a labyrinth of failing systems. She sent the money, watching the confirmation screen load slowly on the overtaxed cellular network.

That evening, as she drove home through streets lined with dead landscaping, Anika passed a church with a marquee that read: "REPENT FOR THE END IS NEAR." She used to find such signs melodramatic. Now she wondered if they weren't understated. The end wasn't near; it was already here, unfolding in slow motion, a catastrophe measured in incremental losses—a species gone, a glacier melted, a child's lung scarred.

Her own apartment felt like a time capsule from a more optimistic era: books on shelves, plants in pots, photographs of family trips to beaches that no longer existed in their photographed form. She watered the plants with the graywater she collected from her shower, careful not to waste a drop.

Before bed, she opened her laptop and logged into the international medical forum. Doctors from around the world reported similar scenes: heat-related illnesses in India, waterborne diseases in flood-ravaged Bangladesh, malnutrition in the Sahel, mental health crises in fire-ravaged Australia. They shared treatment protocols, research findings, desperate workarounds for supply shortages.

A doctor from Lagos posted: "We have run out of IV fluids. Using oral rehydration solution for severe dehydration cases. Mortality up 40%."

A doctor from Santiago: "Wildfire smoke overwhelming our air filtration. Respiratory admissions doubling weekly."

A doctor from Berlin: "Refugee influx from Mediterranean drought zones. Camp conditions breeding drug-resistant infections."

Anika typed: "Georgia, USA. Dust Lung variant. Mortality 34% elderly, 18% children. Out of basic supplies. Sharing our improvised protocols."

She attached the files, hit send, and closed her laptop. The warnings had become data points in a global catastrophe log. The question was no longer how to prevent the crisis, but how to survive it with some shred of humanity intact.

## Scene 3: The Burning Coast

Miguel Santos stood on what remained of the Miami Beach seawall, watching the cranes lift another abandoned Tesla from the flooded street. The saltwater had corroded the battery packs, creating small chemical fires that hissed and sputtered as the cars were hauled away. The air smelled of brine, decay, and the sweet-sick odor of rotting marine life.

His crew worked in silence, their faces hidden behind respirators. The "sunny day floods" had become daily occurrences, then hourly ones. Now, during king tides, the ocean simply reclaimed the streets, flowing through storm drains in reverse, bubbling up through manhole covers with the insistence of a force that could no longer be denied.

"Miguel! Over here!"

Carlos, his foreman, waved from a half-submerged apartment building. The ground-floor units showed water lines at chest height, the drywall bloated and peeling like diseased skin. Mold patterns spread across ceilings in intricate, toxic blooms.

"FEMA says red tag the whole building," Carlos said, handing him the clipboard. "Structural compromise from saltwater infiltration. They want it down by the end of the month."

Miguel scanned the report. Another fifty families displaced, another piece of the neighborhood erased. He'd grown up in this building, in unit 3B. His mother had hung laundry on the balcony, the sheets snapping in the ocean breeze. Now that balcony sagged, its concrete spalling, rebar exposed like bones.

"Any residents still here?"

Carlos nodded toward the upper floors. "A few holdouts. Mostly elderly. They say they'd rather drown than leave."

Miguel climbed the stairs, the concrete steps crumbling at the edges. On the fourth floor, he found Mrs. Rosario sitting in her doorway, a folding chair positioned to catch whatever breeze made it through the boarded-up windows. At ninety-two, she had survived the Cuban Revolution, the Mariel boatlift, and forty years of Miami's transformation from sleepy retirement community to glittering metropolis to climate casualty.

"Miguelito," she said, her voice still strong. "You here to throw me out too?"

"No, Doña Rosario. Just checking on you."

She snorted. "Checking if I'm dead yet. Not yet, mijo. Not yet."

He sat on the step below her, the familiar gesture of respect he'd shown since childhood. "The building isn't safe. The foundation—"

"I know what's wrong with the foundation. I watched the ocean eat it, little by little, year by year. You think I don't see?"

She gestured toward the window, where a crack in the plywood showed a slice of turquoise water where the street used to be. "My husband and I bought this apartment in 1985. We saved for ten years. He worked construction, I cleaned hotels. We wanted to be near the water." She laughed, a dry sound. "Be careful what you wish for, eh?"

Miguel remembered her husband, a quiet man who had taught him how to tie fishing knots on that same balcony. The fish were mostly gone now—either dead from ocean acidification or moved to cooler waters. The coral reefs that had once made this coast a diving destination were bleached skeletons, their colors faded like old photographs.

"Where will you go?" he asked.

She shrugged. "My daughter in Orlando says she has room. But Orlando is hot, and inland, and not home." She looked at him sharply. "You still live in Little Havana?"

"For now. But the insurance companies are pulling out. No one will write new policies south of Eighth Street."

"Smart," she said. "This whole city is a bad investment. But we're not investments, are we? We're people."

Below them, the crew continued their work, the mechanical sounds of demolition echoing through the hollowed-out building. Miguel thought about the paradox of his job: he was part of the retreat, the managed withdrawal from the coasts, but every building he demolished represented someone's life, someone's memory, someone's accumulated hope.

"Tell me something, Miguelito," Mrs. Rosario said. "When you tear down these buildings, what happens to the stories? The fights in the kitchens, the babies born in the bedrooms, the Christmas dinners? Do they just disappear?"

He had no answer. The physical structures could be dismantled, the materials recycled or sent to landfills, but the memories had nowhere to go. They clung to people who carried them inland, becoming ghosts in new places.

Later that afternoon, as Miguel supervised the removal of the building's electrical panel, his phone rang. It was his wife, Isabella.

"The school called," she said, her voice tight. "Lucas had another asthma attack. They're saying we should consider moving. The air quality—"

"I know," he said, watching a crane swing a bundle of rebar toward the waiting truck. "I know."

Their son was eight, part of the first generation to carry climate change in their bodies—in their lungs, their skin, their immune systems. The pediatrician had shown them the charts: asthma rates up 300% in coastal Florida children since 2015, heat-related illnesses becoming commonplace, anxiety disorders diagnosed in kids who had nightmares about drowning.

"We can't keep doing this," Isabella said. "Every storm season I'm packing go-bags, watching the evacuation maps. I'm tired of being afraid."

"Where would we go?"

"Atlanta. My cousin says they have jobs in climate adaptation. You could work on building the new infrastructure instead of tearing down the old."

Miguel looked at the skyline of Miami, the gleaming towers that now stood like tombstones marking a city's ambition. The developers had built right up to the water's edge, confident that engineering could defeat nature. They had been wrong, and now ordinary people paid the price.

"Let's talk tonight," he said. "I'll be home by seven."

He hung up and returned to work. Carlos handed him a small object—a child's plastic toy, a dinosaur, half-melted from sun exposure.

"Found it in the rubble," Carlos said. "Kid must have left it behind."

Miguel turned the toy over in his hand. The plastic was warm, almost pliable. He thought about the child who had owned it, now displaced, carrying this loss among many others. He pocketed the dinosaur, a small act of preservation in an era of erasure.

As the sun set, painting the flooded streets in shades of orange and pink, Miguel's crew packed up their equipment. The building stood half-demolished, its interior exposed like a dollhouse. In one of the upper units, a light flickered on—Mrs. Rosario, defying orders, staying in her home until the last possible moment.

He didn't report her. Let her have these final nights with her memories, with the ghost of her husband, with the sound of the ocean that had been both companion and destroyer. The warning had come too late for this building, this street, this version of Miami. But maybe, Miguel thought as he drove away, they could build something new inland, something that respected the boundaries nature had always drawn.

## Scene 4: The Seed Bank

Dr. Eleanor Vance walked through the -20°C chill of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, her breath forming clouds that hung in the still air. The vault stretched into the permafrost, a cathedral of biodiversity carved into the Arctic mountain. Row after row of metal shelves held gray boxes, each containing thousands of seed samples from every agricultural region on Earth.

Today's delivery had come from Syria—what remained of the Aleppo seed bank after years of war and drought. The researchers had managed to evacuate most of the collection before the final collapse, shipping it via diplomatic pouch to Norway. Now Eleanor and her team were cataloging, testing viability, and preparing the seeds for long-term storage.

Her assistant, a young botanist named Kaito, carefully opened one of the boxes. Inside, smaller packets were labeled in Arabic and English: "Triticum aestivum, Aleppo variant, drought-resistant, 2018 harvest."

"These are the ones they bred for the changing climate," Kaito said, his voice hushed in the cold silence. "The last harvest before the civil war made research impossible."

Eleanor took one of the packets, feeling the weight of the seeds through the foil. Each one represented decades of selective breeding, of farmers saving the best specimens year after year, of scientists identifying genetic traits that might help crops survive hotter, drier conditions. And now they were here, in a frozen mountain
