**Chapter 11: THE TRENCHES**

The mud had memory. It remembered every boot that sank into it, every body that fell, every drop of blood that seeped down through the chalk and clay. The Western Front in the autumn of 1916 was not a line but a wound—a suppurating gash across the face of Europe that wept men and machines into the earth.

Private Thomas Miller of the 16th Lancashire Fusiliers learned the mud's language in his first week. It spoke in sucking sounds when he pulled his boots free, in wet plops when rats surfaced from their tunnels, in the slow seep that filled every hole overnight. The trench walls wept constantly, water trickling down through the sandbags and duckboards to pool in the bottom, where it mixed with urine, blood, and the chemical tang of chloride of lime.

Thomas was nineteen, though his hands looked forty. The skin had cracked and calloused around the knuckles, the nails black with dirt that wouldn't wash out. He'd been a clerk in Manchester before the posters called. Now he held a Lee-Enfield rifle whose wood stock had absorbed the sweat of the man who'd carried it before him—a man named Jenkins who'd caught a sniper's bullet through the throat while checking the wire.

"Keep your head down, Miller," Corporal Shaw whispered beside him. Shaw had been at the Somme. He had a way of moving that seemed to borrow stillness from the earth itself. "The Hun's got good glass today."

Thomas peered through a gap in the sandbags. No Man's Land stretched before them—a cratered moonscape of shattered trees, rusted wire, and things that used to be men. The smell reached him even here: cordite, decay, the sweet-rotten scent of gangrene carried on the wind. A hundred yards away, German trenches mirrored their own. Between them lay the dead.

"See that?" Shaw pointed with a grimy finger. "Third crater from the left. Jerry's got a listening post there. They dig at night, same as us."

Thomas squinted. The crater looked like all the others—a soup of mud and debris. Then he saw it: the faintest glint of steel, the barest movement of a shadow within shadow.

"How do you know?"

"Because I put three men in that hole last month," Shaw said, his voice flat. "They never came out."

The trench system was a fractal city dug into hell. Forward trenches, support trenches, reserve trenches—each connected by communication trenches that snaked backward for miles. At every junction, men huddled in dugouts carved into the chalk, their faces pale as mushrooms in the perpetual twilight. Some slept standing up, leaning against the walls. Others wrote letters home with pencils stubby as fingernails.

Thomas's section shared a dugout with six others. The space was six feet by four, the ceiling so low they had to crouch. A single candle guttered in a tin can, casting shadows that danced like the dead. On the wall, someone had carved "Blighty 1917" with a bayonet point.

"Mail's up," said Private Davies, tossing a bundle of letters onto the makeshift table—an ammunition crate balanced on petrol tins. "Miller, you've got one."

Thomas's hands shook as he took the envelope. His mother's handwriting, the paper thin as onion skin. He didn't open it immediately. Letters were dangerous things—portals to a world where the sun still rose cleanly over undamaged fields, where food didn't taste of tin and fear, where people slept through the night without jumping at every shell-burst.

"Bad news travels fast enough," Shaw had told him once. "Let the good news wait until you can savor it."

Instead, Thomas watched Davies read his own letter. The man's face underwent a transformation—the hard lines around his mouth softening, the perpetual squint easing. For thirty seconds, he wasn't in a trench in France. He was somewhere with daffodils and a woman's laugh.

"Baby girl," Davies said, not looking up. "Born last Tuesday. Seven pounds even. They're calling her Eleanor."

The men murmured congratulations. Someone produced a flask and passed it around. The whiskey burned going down, a different kind of heat than the constant low-grade fever of trench life.

"First drink for the father," said Private Collins, a Welshman with a voice like gravel. "May she never know this place."

They drank to that. In the candlelight, their faces were a gallery of what war did to men: Collins missing two fingers on his left hand, Davies with a scar that pulled his right eye into a permanent squint, Shaw whose hands trembled slightly when he wasn't holding something.

Thomas finally opened his letter. His mother wrote about the garden, about his sister's wedding plans, about the cat who'd had kittens. Normal things. At the bottom, in her careful script: "We pray for you every night. Your father says to keep your socks dry."

He folded the letter carefully, tucking it into his tunic pocket over his heart. The paper felt like armor.

* * *

The attack came at dawn, as attacks often did.

It began with the artillery—a sound that started in the bones before it reached the ears. The German guns opened up first, their shells screaming overhead to fall somewhere behind the lines. Then their own artillery answered, the concussions shaking the trench walls so that dirt rained down on their helmets.

"Stand to!" Shaw shouted, though everyone was already at the firestep, rifles ready.

For twenty minutes, the world was noise and vibration. Thomas pressed himself against the trench wall, his mouth open to equalize pressure in his ears. He could feel the explosions through the soles of his boots—a deep, rhythmic thumping that traveled up through his legs into his chest.

Then, silence.

Not true silence, but the relative quiet after the barrage lifted. In that space, they heard the whistles.

"Over the top!" Shaw was first up the ladder, his bayonet fixed. "Go! Go!"

Thomas climbed, his hands slippery on the wet wood. The top of the trench was a different world—open, exposed, the sky gray with smoke and dawn. All along the line, men were pouring out, a khaki wave breaking against the earth.

He ran because everyone ran. The ground was treacherous—crater holes hidden by mist, tangles of wire, bodies in various states of decomposition. He jumped over a German soldier lying face-up in the mud, the man's eyes open to the rain, his mouth full of water.

A machine gun opened up to their left. The sound was like ripping canvas. Men fell in twos and threes, some silently, some screaming. Thomas kept running, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The German trench was a dark line ahead, growing closer.

He saw Davies go down—not from a bullet, but from stepping on something that exploded beneath him. One moment he was running, the next he was on the ground, his leg gone below the knee. He didn't scream immediately. He looked surprised, as if he'd tripped over an unexpected stair.

Thomas kept running. Darwin's meat and bone, defying entropy with every step. The body was a machine that didn't know it should stop. Heart pumping, lungs burning, muscles contracting—all of it automatic, all of it insisting on forward motion even as the mind screamed to turn back.

He reached the German trench just as the first wave of his comrades jumped in. The fighting here was intimate—bayonets and rifle butts in close quarters. Thomas found himself facing a German soldier no older than himself. The boy's eyes were wide with the same fear Thomas felt. They circled each other for a second that stretched into eternity.

Then Collins came from the side, his entrenching tool swinging in a short, brutal arc. The German went down, and Thomas moved on.

They took the trench. It looked remarkably like their own—same duckboards, same sandbags, same smell of men living too close together for too long. The German dead lay where they'd fallen. The living—those who hadn't retreated—were being rounded up, their hands on their heads.

Thomas leaned against the trench wall, vomiting up the breakfast he hadn't eaten. His hands wouldn't stop shaking.

"Here," Shaw said, handing him a canteen. "Drink."

The water tasted of metal and mud. Thomas drank anyway.

"Davies?" he asked.

Shaw shook his head. "Gone before we got to him."

They held the trench for three hours before the counterattack. The Germans came back with flamethrowers—men carrying tanks of fuel on their backs, hoses spraying liquid fire that clung to everything it touched. Thomas saw a man from his company catch a direct hit. He became a running torch for ten steps before collapsing into a crater.

They fell back to their original lines, carrying what wounded they could. The attack had gained two hundred yards of mud at the cost of forty-seven men from their battalion alone.

Back in their dugout, Thomas sat with his head in his hands. The shaking had moved inward, to some deep place behind his sternum. He could still see the German boy's face—the surprise in his eyes just before Collins's tool connected.

"You'll get used to it," Collins said, cleaning his bayonet with a rag. "Or you won't. Either way, you'll keep doing it."

That night, the rats came. They were fat things, bold from feeding on the dead. Thomas watched one drag a finger—just a finger, severed and gray—across the duckboards. It stopped to look at him, its eyes gleaming in the dark, before continuing on its way.

* * *

The night raid came three weeks later.

The air was a cold broth of wet earth, cordite, and the sweet-rotten undersmell that no one mentioned by day. Corporal Shaw moved down the line in the sap-head, a darker shadow in the absolute dark, smearing handfuls of cold slick muck across each man's face. Thomas flinched at the touch. The mud filled the creases of his eyelids, clotted his lashes, tasted of soil and decay when it touched his lips. It was a baptism into nothing.

"No talkin'. No coughin'. You see a flare, you freeze. Become part of the ground." Shaw's whisper was a dry rustle by Thomas's ear. His own breath sounded monstrous in his ears, his heart a frantic prisoner against his ribs. He checked his rifle for the tenth time, the bayonet locked, its cold length a promise he did not want to keep.

They went over the parapet not as men, but as creatures. Belly-down on the freezing duckboards, then into the soup of No Man's Land. The darkness was a physical weight. He crawled, pushing his rifle ahead, the world reduced to the squelch of his own movement, the distant sporadic pop of a flare pistol miles away. Then the wire. A tangled scripture of violence. He slid under it, feeling the rusted barbs catch and pluck at his tunic like pleading fingers. A corpse hung there, frozen in a permanent dance, its cloth and flesh part of the metallic thicket. Thomas pressed his face into the freezing mud to pass beneath it, the smell of death immediate and personal.

A sudden crack and hiss. A German flare burst overhead, swinging on its parachute. Magnesium-white light bleached the world into stark, terrible relief: the craters like open sores, the skeletal trees, the men around him frozen in mid-crawl, eyes wide and white in blackened faces. Thomas stopped breathing. The light etched the scene onto his soul. Then it died, and the darkness rushed back, thicker, more blinding than before.

They reached the enemy parapet. A low mutter of German, the scrape of a boot on firestep. Shaw's whistle split the night—a short, sharp shriek.

Chaos is a poor word. It was a compression of time into a series of jarring, sensory blows. The grunt of men dropping into the trench. A choked-off cry. The wet thunk of an entrenching tool. The air, already foul, now sharp with the coppery tang of blood and the acrid bite of fear. Thomas stumbled around a traverse, his bayonet leading.

And then he was there.

A German soldier, fumbling with his rifle strap, turning. Their eyes met in the gloom. He was a boy. A smooth face under a too-large helmet, wide with a terror that mirrored Thomas's own. He couldn't have been older than nineteen. For a suspended second, they were locked in a perfect, silent understanding. No hatred, no cause—just two animals in a hole, paralyzed by the same primal script.

The German's hands finally found his rifle, began to raise it. The movement broke the spell. Thomas lunged. It was not skill, but blind forward motion. The bayonet punched—through wool, through flesh, meeting the resistance of bone before sliding deeper. The boy gasped, a soft, surprised sound, close enough for Thomas to feel the warmth of his breath. He sagged against Thomas, his weight sudden and intimate on the end of the rifle. Thomas stared, nose to nose. He saw the shock in the boy's eyes, a clarity that seemed to look through him to some point far beyond this trench. Then the light in them changed. Not a dimming, but a shifting—the awareness behind them simply vanished, leaving only wet, empty glass. The boy's body slid off the bayonet with a terrible, soft finality.

The raid was over in minutes. The whistle blew again, the retreat. Thomas stood over the body, his rifle slick. The world had narrowed to a tunnel, the sounds of withdrawal muffled and distant. A profound coldness seeped from his core outward.

Back in the muck of No Man's Land, crawling now with the German machine guns awake and stitching the dark with red tracers, the reaction hit him. It began as a tremor in his hands, a vibration that traveled up his arms and seized his entire frame. His stomach convulsed. He rolled onto his side and vomited into a shell-hole, heaving until it was only bile and shame. He could still feel the precise give of the body, the warmth of the breath. He wiped his mouth with a shaking, filthy hand, staring at it as if it belonged to someone else.

A strong grip hauled him up by his webbing. Corporal Shaw's face was a grim mask of mud and shadow. "Not here, lad. Move." Shaw half-dragged him the last twenty yards, bundling him over the parapet where they collapsed together on the firestep. Thomas's teeth chattered uncontrollably. He looked at his hands again, clean of mud where they had gripped the rifle, but he saw only the other boy's eyes, the moment the life left them, not with a hero's flourish, but with the simple, awful subtraction of a soul. It was not an enemy he had killed. It was a boy. And the mud, which remembered every boot, now remembered that, too.

* * *

December brought a cold so deep it seemed to freeze time itself.

The singing began after midnight, drifting across the frozen waste of No Man's Land. It was *Stille Nacht*, the melody unmistakable even in German. The voices were thin, borne on the brittle December air, but they carried a profound quiet that stilled the perpetual background rumble of the guns.

No one spoke. They climbed the parapet, their shapes black against the star-pricked sky, moving with the slow uncertainty of sleepwalkers. From the opposite line, dark forms emerged in kind. The world had narrowed to this frozen strip, its craters silvered with frost. Thomas's heart hammered against his ribs, a trapped animal feeling the cage door swing open.

They met in the middle, where the barbed wire was a tattered silhouette. A German with a gaunt, kind face offered a crumpled packet of cigarettes. Thomas, his fingers numb, produced a tin of bully beef. The exchange was wordless, a ritual of mutual need. Then came the photographs, creased and stained, passed from frozen hand to frozen hand. A cottage garden here, a formal studio portrait there. Smiles from another life, eyes untouched by this.

A young German, his uniform hanging loose, pointed to himself. "Karl," he said. Then he fumbled inside his greatcoat and produced a small, carefully protected picture. He held it out to Thomas. It showed a woman with tired, proud eyes, holding a swaddled infant. "Lena," Karl said, tapping the baby. "*Tochter.* Daughter." His English was fractured, hauled up from some distant schoolroom. "Sie... sie hat nicht mein Gesicht gesehen." He looked at Thomas, seeking understanding. She has not seen my face.

The sentence hung in the air between them, a perfect, devastating truth. Thomas thought of his own family, the faces in his mother's letters that were slowly becoming abstractions. In that shared glance was an entire history of absence—the missing first steps, the first words spoken into other ears, the slow transformation of a stranger in a frame into a real child they might never know. The uniform, the nation, the cause—it all fell away like rotten cloth, revealing the bare architecture of a man: fear, love, and a terrible longing for home.

It was a cathedral of silence built in minutes, fragile as the ice on the shell-holes.

The shriek of a whistle tore it down.

It came from the British line, sharp and imperative. The spell shattered. Men flinched as if from a gunshot. For one frozen second, the two groups stood suspended, the ghost of the truce already fading from their eyes. Then they turned and scrambled, slipping and stumbling, back towards their respective darknesses. No shots followed. The machine guns remained silent, but the mercy felt like a deeper cruelty.

Thomas tumbled over the parapet, the familiar stench of wet earth and cordite welcoming him back. He lay panting, his cheek against the frozen revetment. Slowly, he raised his head and stared across the dead space. The German lines were a silent hump against the sky. Somewhere over there, Karl was folding the photograph of his daughter back into its place against his heart.

The shared humanity, so palpable moments before, did not vanish. It retreated, becoming a private, aching weight in the gut. It was worse than hatred. Hatred was simple fuel. This was a knowledge that could not be un-known: that the faceless enemy was a man who missed his child. Tomorrow, or the next day, the guns would speak again. They would be ordered to fire, and they would fire, aiming at the silhouettes that had shared their tobacco and their grief. The tragedy was not that the truce ended, but that it had happened at all. It had shown them the bottomless depth of the pit into which they were all being poured.

* * *

The gas arrived on a still morning in early 1917.

"Gas! Gas! GAS!"

The cry went down the line, passed from man to man with a urgency that cut through the usual morning lethargy. Thomas fumbled with his respirator, the rubber mask smelling of chemicals and other men's breath. He got it on just as the yellow-green cloud drifted over the parapet.

Mustard gas. It rolled along the ground, heavier than air, seeping into every hollow and crater. Through the fogged lenses of his mask, Thomas watched it pool in the bottom of the trench. A man two bays down hadn't gotten his mask on in time. He was coughing violently, his hands at his throat.

"Get him to the aid post!" Shaw shouted.

But the gas was everywhere now. It clung to uniforms, to skin, to the wooden duckboards. It had no immediate smell—just a faint sweetness that later gave way to the scent of garlic and horseradish.

They sat in the trench for hours, masks on, waiting for the cloud to dissipate. Thomas's eyes watered inside the mask. The rubber chafed against his face. He breathed in the filtered air, each inhalation a conscious effort.

When the all-clear finally sounded, they removed their masks cautiously. The air still carried the chemical tang, but it was breathable.

The man who hadn't gotten his mask on in time—Private Wilson—was blind. His eyes were swollen shut, weeping yellow fluid. Blisters were already forming on his neck and hands where the gas had touched exposed skin.

"Help me," Wilson whispered, his voice raw. "I can't see."

They led him down the communication trench to the aid post. Wilson stumbled every few steps, his hands outstretched before him. By the time they arrived, the blisters had spread up his arms. They would spread to his lungs next, filling them with fluid until he drowned in his own secretions.

The doctor—a young captain with exhaustion etched into his face—took one look and shook his head. "Nothing to be done. Make him comfortable."

They put Wilson on a stretcher in a corner of the dugout that served as a dressing station. Thomas stayed with him for a while, holding his hand. The blisters were rising like bubbles in boiling mud.

"My mother," Wilson said. "She'll be waiting for a letter."

"I'll write it," Thomas promised.

"Tell her I wasn't afraid."

Thomas nodded, though Wilson couldn't see him. "I'll tell her."

Wilson died three hours later, his breathing becoming increasingly ragged until it stopped altogether. They wrapped him in a groundsheet and carried him to the rear. There were too many for individual graves now. They went into pits, twenty at a time.

That evening, Thomas sat with Shaw on the firestep, watching the German lines. The sky was the color of a fresh bruise.

"Does it get easier?" Thomas asked.

Shaw lit a cigarette, cupping the match against the wind. "No. You just get better at carrying it."

They sat in silence for a while. From somewhere down the line came the sound of a harmonica playing "It's a Long Way to Tipperary." The notes were thin and reedy in the vastness of the night.

"You know why we keep going?" Shaw said finally.

Thomas shook his head.

"Because the man next to you is. And he's going because you are. That's all there is, in the end. Not king or country. Just the man in the hole beside you."

A star shell went up from the German lines, bathing No Man's Land in eerie white light. For a few seconds, the craters and wire stood out in sharp relief. Then darkness returned, deeper than before.

* * *

A new dampness hung in the air of the support trench that spring, a clinging miasma that was more than the usual stench of cordite and decay. It carried a sound: a dry, rattling cough that echoed down the duckboards, punctuating the sporadic shelling from the German lines.

Private Ellis was the first to go down properly. A strapping lad from Lancashire, he'd been complaining of a headache for two days, shivering in his greatcoat despite the mild spring drizzle. Then, at stand-to, his knees simply buckled. They carried him to the aid post, his skin burning to the touch. Captain Greville, the battalion doctor, listened to his chest. The sound was wrong—a deep, liquid congestion that had nothing to do with the chronic bronchitis of the trenches. It wasn't gas; there'd been no alarm. It wasn't trench fever. The medic's brow furrowed as he wiped his stethoscope, his unease a silent, spreading stain.

More followed. Young men, the healthiest of the recent reinforcements, were now huddled in funk holes, wracked by fevers that spiked and plunged. Their eyes grew glassy, their powerful frames diminished within hours. The cough travelled, jumping from bay to bay, a contagion more stealthy than any sniper. Rumours came with the rations. A runner from brigade mentioned whole sections of the German line had gone quiet, not from artillery, but from sickness. "They're calling it the *Blitzkatarrh* over there," he muttered. "Lightning catarrh." The news was perversely comforting, then immediately terrifying. This enemy observed no front line, saluted no flag.

It was during evening roll call that it declared itself openly. The replacements, fresh-faced boys from a Middlesex regiment, stood in a sloppy line as Sergeant Hale barked names. "Cartwright!" A tall, broad-shouldered youth took a half-step forward, opened his mouth to answer, and instead vomited thin bile onto the duckboards. He swayed, his face the colour of clay, then collapsed in a heap. The sergeant's shout of "Stretcher-bearers!" held a new, sharp note of alarm.

In the cramped dugout that served as a surgery, Captain Greville examined the unconscious Cartwright. The fever was ferocious. The cyanotic tinge around the lips was not from cold. He placed his hand on the boy's chest, feeling the frantic, shallow struggle beneath. This was no incremental decline. This was a swift, violent takeover.

Greville stepped outside, lighting a cigarette with hands that betrayed the slightest tremor. He looked down the serpentine trench, a gash in the earth teeming with life now hosting something new. They feared shells, and gas, and the bayonet. They had drills for each. But this? This crept in on the breath, felling the strong before the weak, a harvest that preferred the ripe grain. The war had taught him the geometry of death—trajectories and blast radii, predictable and containable. What now breathed in the dark felt chaotic, vast, and hungry in a way metal could never be. He dropped the cigarette, crushing it into the pervasive mud. The guns rumbled in the distance, an old and familiar threat. The real storm, he sensed with a cold, clinical dread, was just beginning to gather.

* * *

The Spanish flu arrived in the spring of 1918, though they didn't call it that yet. It came with the reinforcements—fresh-faced boys from England who brought with them a cough that sounded like tearing paper.

At first, it seemed like just another illness. Men got fevers, chills, aches. They went to the aid post, were given aspirin and told to rest. But this was different. Healthy young men went from standing to dead in forty-eight hours. Their skin turned blue, then black. They coughed up blood, their lungs filling with fluid until they drowned on dry land.

Thomas woke one morning to find Collins burning with fever. The Welshman's skin was hot to the touch, his breathing rapid and shallow.

"Just a cold," Collins insisted, though he couldn't stand without help.

By afternoon, he was delirious, calling for people Thomas didn't know—a brother named Rhys, a woman named Gwen. His cough had a wet, rattling sound that filled the dugout.

"Get him to the hospital," Shaw ordered.

But the hospitals were overflowing. The flu was everywhere—in the trenches, in the villages behind the lines, on the ships crossing the Channel. It didn't care about sides. German prisoners brought in that week were coughing too.

They carried Collins to a field hospital set up in a barn. The scene inside was something from a medieval plague painting. Cots lined every available space, men lying cheek by jowl. The air was thick with the smell of sickness—sweat, vomit, the coppery tang of blood.

A nurse with dark circles under her eyes took one look at Collins and pointed to a space on the floor. "There. We have no more cots."

They laid Collins on a blanket. His breathing was worse now, each inhalation a struggle.

"Stay with him," Shaw told Thomas. "I'll try to find a doctor."

Thomas sat on the floor beside Collins, wiping his forehead with a damp cloth. The Welshman's eyes opened briefly.

"Thomas?"

"I'm here."

"The singing," Collins whispered. "Can you hear it?"

Thomas listened. All he heard were the sounds of dying men—coughing, moaning, the occasional cry for mother or God.

"It's beautiful," Collins said, his eyes closing again.

He died an hour later, just as the sun was setting. Thomas watched the life leave him—a subtle change, like a light going out in a distant window. One moment Collins was there, the next he was just meat and bone.

They buried him that night, in a field behind the barn. The grave was shallow—just deep enough to keep the rats out. Thomas said what he remembered of the Lord's Prayer, though the words felt hollow in his mouth.

When he returned to the trench, he found a letter waiting. His sister had given birth to a boy. They'd named him Thomas, after his uncle.

He read the letter by candlelight, tracing the words with a finger that still had Collins's dried blood under the nail. New life, announced in the midst of so much death. The contradiction should have been unbearable, but somehow it wasn't. It was just how things were.

* * *

The armistice came on November 11, 1918. The news traveled down the line like a reverse shockwave. At first, no one believed it. Then the guns fell silent—not just theirs, but the German guns too. The quiet that followed was louder than any bombardment.

Thomas stood on the firestep, looking out over No Man's Land. For four years, this strip of earth had been the most dangerous place in the world. Now, men were climbing out of their trenches on both sides, meeting in the middle.

He climbed out too. The ground was frozen hard, crunching under his boots. He walked toward the German lines, past craters he'd jumped over a hundred times, past wire entanglements that had claimed so many.

A German soldier was walking toward him. They met in the middle, where the ground was churned to powder by shellfire. The German was young, with pale blue eyes and a thin face. He held out his hand.

Thomas took it. The German's grip was firm.

"Es ist vorbei," the German said. It's over.

Thomas nodded. He had a chocolate bar in his pocket—a gift from a Red Cross parcel. He broke it in half and offered one piece to the German.

They stood there together, eating chocolate in the middle of No Man's Land. All around them, other men were doing the same—shaking hands, exchanging cigarettes, showing photographs of home. For a few hours, the war ceased to exist.

That night, back in the trench, Thomas packed his kit. He had little to take—a few letters, a photograph of his family, Collins's harmonica (the Welshman had left it to him), his rifle and bayonet. The rifle would be turned in. The bayonet he would keep, though he didn't know why.

Shaw sat beside him, cleaning his own rifle for the last time.

"Going home," Shaw said, as if testing the words.

"Home," Thomas echoed. The word had lost its meaning. Home was a place where people slept through the night, where food didn't come in tins, where the ground wasn't full of bodies. He wasn't sure he remembered how to be in such a place.

They marched out the next morning, leaving the trenches behind. As they moved toward the rear, Thomas looked back once. The line of trenches stretched to the horizon in both directions—a scar on the earth that would take generations to heal, if it ever did.

The villages they passed through were in ruins. Houses stood with their walls blown out, revealing the intimate spaces within—a bed still made, a table set for a meal that would never be eaten, a child's toy lying in the rubble. People were emerging from cellars and shelters, their faces pale from years underground.
