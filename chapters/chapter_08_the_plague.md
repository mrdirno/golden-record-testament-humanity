**Chapter 8: THE PLAGUE**

The rats came first, though no one noticed them. They moved through the grain stores of Kaffa with the same quiet persistence that had carried their ancestors across continents. When the Genoese ships fled the siege, the rats went with them, nestled in the straw bedding, hidden in the grain sacks, clinging to the ropes with their sharp claws. They carried the sickness in their blood, and the fleas that drank that blood carried it in their bellies.

The first ship reached Messina in October 1347. The sailors were already dying. Their skin showed dark swellings in the groin and armpits, some as large as apples, others like eggs. They coughed blood that stained their beards and tunics. The townspeople saw the ships anchored offshore, heard the moans carrying across the water, and refused them entry. They rowed out with torches and arrows, shouting for the ships to leave. But the rats swam ashore in the night.

**Scene One: The Carpenter's Workshop, Florence, 1348**

Marco's hands knew the wood before his eyes did. His fingers traced the grain of the oak beam, feeling for the subtle curve that would determine how it bore weight. The workshop smelled of sawdust and linseed oil, with the underlying scent of sweat from three generations of carpenters who had worked these same tools. His father's tools, his grandfather's before him.

"Marco!" His wife Lucia stood in the doorway, her face pale. "Giovanni's boy. He's feverish."

Marco set down his plane. The shavings curled at his feet like wood-colored ribbons. "The swelling?"

She nodded, unable to speak. Her hands twisted in her apron.

The street outside was quieter than it should have been. Usually at this hour, the sound of hammers and saws filled the air, the shouts of merchants, the laughter of children chasing chickens. Today there was only the wind, carrying the smell of something burning from the eastern quarter.

Giovanni's house stood two streets over. The door was marked with a red cross, fresh paint still dripping. Inside, the boy lay on a straw mattress, his breathing ragged. The bubo under his left arm had broken open, weeping dark fluid that stained the sheets. Giovanni sat beside him, holding a damp cloth that he no longer bothered to apply.

"He won't drink," Giovanni said without looking up. His voice was flat, emptied of hope.

Marco knelt. The boy's skin was hot to the touch, his eyes glassy. "Luca," Marco whispered. "Can you hear me?"

The boy's lips moved, but no sound came out. His fingers twitched, reaching for something only he could see.

They buried him that evening, in the new ground outside the city walls where the graves were dug shoulder to shoulder. The priest said the words quickly, his eyes darting to the gathering clouds. When Marco helped lower the small wrapped body into the earth, his hands remembered holding Luca just months before, showing him how to hold a chisel, how to feel for the true line in the wood.

Three days later, Giovanni developed the cough. It started as a dry tickle, then became something deeper, something that tore at his lungs. He coughed blood into a basin, bright red at first, then darker, like wine left too long in the cask. By the week's end, he was gone.

Marco's daughter Caterina fell ill the following Tuesday. She was seven, with her mother's dark eyes and a laugh that sounded like bells. The fever took her quickly. She burned through two nights, her small body shaking with chills even as her skin felt like embers. On the third morning, she opened her eyes, looked at Marco, and said, "Papa, the angels are singing." Then she closed them and did not open them again.

Lucia washed the body herself. She heated water over the fire, added lavender from the garden, and cleaned every inch of her daughter's skin. She combed the dark hair, braided it with a blue ribbon, dressed her in the confirmation dress that was already too small. Her hands moved with a terrible precision, as if by performing these rituals perfectly, she could undo what had happened.

When she finished, she looked at Marco. "We should leave."

"Where?" he asked.

"Anywhere. The countryside. The mountains."

"The sickness is everywhere, Lucia. The couriers say it's in Milan, in Venice, in Rome."

"Then we die here?"

Marco looked at his hands. The calluses from years of work, the scar on his thumb from a slipped chisel when he was fourteen, the dirt under his nails that never quite washed out. These hands had built houses, furniture, cradles. Now they would dig graves.

"We stay," he said. "We help where we can."

That night, he went to the workshop. He took down the longest planks of pine, the straightest-grained oak. He worked through the dark hours, by candlelight, measuring, cutting, joining. When dawn came, he had built six coffins. Small ones.

**Scene Two: The Monastery Infirmary, Avignon, 1348**

Brother Thomas had taken his vows twenty years earlier, drawn to the silence of the cloister, the rhythm of prayer, the certainty of ritual. Now the silence was different. The monastery bells still rang for matins and vespers, but fewer voices answered the call each day.

The infirmary had been the library. They moved the books to the cellar, stacked the manuscripts in crates, and laid straw on the stone floor. Now the room smelled of sickness and incense, of vomit and myrrh.

Thomas moved between the pallets, offering water, changing dressings, listening to confessions. The dying wanted to confess everything—petty thefts, jealous thoughts, lustful glances. They clutched at his robe with hands that left dark prints, their fingers swollen at the joints.

A young man named Pierre lay near the window. He had been a scribe, with delicate hands that now trembled uncontrollably. The buboes in his groin had turned black and hard.

"Brother," Pierre whispered. "I copied a psalter last month. For the bishop. I made an error in the Latin. Deliberately."

Thomas dipped a cloth in water, pressed it to Pierre's forehead. "What error?"

"I changed 'misericordia' to 'miseria.' Mercy to misery. I was angry about my wages." Pierre's breath came in short gasps. "Will God forgive me?"

"God forgives everything," Thomas said, though he was no longer certain.

"Even this?" Pierre gestured weakly at the room, at the bodies around them.

"Especially this."

Later, in the chapel, Thomas tried to pray. The words felt like stones in his mouth. He looked at the crucifix above the altar, at the carved figure of Christ in agony. For the first time, he saw not divinity but anatomy—the ribs showing through the skin, the tendons in the wrists stretched taut, the face contorted in a very human pain.

The abbot found him there. "We're running out of wine for the Eucharist."

"Use water," Thomas said.

"The canon—"

"God will understand."

The abbot looked older than his years. The skin around his eyes was dark, his hands shook slightly. "Brother Martin died this morning. And Brother Stephen."

Thomas nodded. He had helped wrap their bodies.

"They're saying it's the Jews," the abbot said quietly. "That they poisoned the wells."

"Who is saying this?"

"The mob in the city. They burned a house yesterday. A Jewish family inside."

Thomas stood up. His knees cracked. "We should speak against this."

"And say what? That God is punishing us all equally? That there is no reason?" The abbot's voice broke. "People need someone to blame, Thomas. They need to believe it can be stopped."

That night, Thomas left the monastery. He walked through streets that were too quiet, past houses marked with crosses, past piles of belongings burned in the squares. He came to the Jewish quarter, where the air still smelled of smoke. A child's doll lay in the gutter, its cloth face blackened.

He picked it up, brushed off the ash. The stitching around one eye had come loose, giving the doll a lopsided, mournful expression. He carried it back to the infirmary, placed it on the table where he prepared medicines. It watched him as he worked.

A woman was brought in near dawn. She had been beaten, her face swollen, her clothes torn. She whispered in a language Thomas didn't recognize. He cleaned her wounds, gave her water, sat with her as her breathing slowed. When she died, he realized he didn't know her name, or what she had believed, or whether anyone would mourn her.

He buried her in the monastery garden, beside the herbs. He said the prayers in Latin, then in the few words of Hebrew he knew. The earth was soft from recent rain. It accepted her easily.

**Scene Three: The Shipyard, Venice, 1349**

The Arsenale di Venezia had built the ships that made Venice an empire. The great galleys took shape here, their ribs rising from the keel like the skeletons of sea monsters. The sound of hammers on wood was the heartbeat of the city.

Now the heartbeat was faltering.

Enrico stood at the dry dock, looking at the half-finished hull. The frames were in place, the planking begun, but work had stopped three weeks ago when the foreman died. Since then, six more shipwrights had fallen ill, then died, then been replaced by men who knew less, worked slower, made mistakes.

His son Matteo worked beside him, caulking the seams between planks. The boy was sixteen, all arms and legs, but his hands were learning. He dipped the oakum into the hot pitch, pressed it into the gap, smoothed it with the iron. The smell of pitch and pine resin filled the air.

"Tighter," Enrico said. "The sea finds every weakness."

Matteo nodded, worked the iron deeper. Sweat dripped from his forehead, mixed with the pitch on his hands.

A shout came from the other end of the yard. One of the laborers had collapsed. Two others helped him up, led him to the water's edge where he vomited into the canal. The water carried it away, toward the lagoon.

Enrico crossed himself. "We should go home."

"We need the wages," Matteo said.

"The wages won't matter if we're dead."

But they stayed. They worked through the afternoon, as the sun moved across the sky, as the shadows lengthened across the yard. The rhythm of work was a kind of prayer—measure, cut, fit, fasten. Each action precise, each joint tight, each nail driven true.

That evening, walking home through the emptying streets, Matteo asked, "Do you think it will end?"

"Everything ends," Enrico said.

"I mean the sickness."

Enrico looked at his son. The boy's face was still smooth, still believing in endings that were neat, that made sense. "I don't know," he said honestly.

Their house was in the Cannaregio district, near the Ghetto. Enrico's father had built it with his own hands, the same hands that taught Enrico to work wood. Three generations of tools hung on the wall—adzes, planes, saws with teeth sharpened so many times the blades were thin as whispers.

Matteo's mother, Sofia, had soup waiting. She moved slowly, her face drawn. She had lost her sister the week before, then her mother two days later. Now she moved through the house like a ghost, performing tasks by memory.

They ate in silence. The soup was thin—beans and a little salt pork. Supplies were running low. The markets were empty, the ships from the East not arriving.

After dinner, Enrico took down his father's violin. The instrument was old, the varnish worn where his father's chin had rested. He tuned it slowly, the notes echoing in the quiet room. Then he played.

The music was a folk tune, something his grandfather had taught him. Simple melody, repeating pattern, the kind of music made for dancing in cramped spaces. He played it through once, then again, letting the variations emerge naturally, the way grain emerges from wood under the plane.

Matteo watched, his head leaning against the wall. Sofia stopped cleaning, stood in the doorway, her hands still wet.

When Enrico finished, the silence felt different. Not empty, but waiting.

"Play another," Matteo said.

Enrico played until his fingers grew stiff, until the candle burned low. He played every song he remembered, and when he ran out of songs, he made up new ones. The notes filled the house, spilled out the window into the dark street, where they mixed with the sounds of other houses—a baby crying, a couple arguing, someone praying in a language that wasn't Latin or Venetian.

That night, Enrico dreamed of ships. Not the galleys of the Arsenale, but smaller boats, fishing boats, the kind his grandfather had used. In the dream, he was building one, but the wood kept changing—oak became pine became willow became something he didn't recognize. His tools kept slipping from his hands. The boat took shape anyway, floating on water that was perfectly clear, so clear he could see to the bottom, where bones lay arranged in patterns, like the ribs of a ship, or a cathedral.

**Scene Four: The University, Paris, 1350**

The lecture hall was empty except for three students. Guillaume de Machaut stood at the podium, his notes spread before him. He was supposed to be teaching music theory, the mathematics of harmony, the ratios that made one chord pleasing and another dissonant.

Instead, he said, "Tell me what you've seen."

The students looked at each other. They were young, their faces still holding the softness of childhood, though their eyes were older.

"My father was a doctor," one said. "He tried everything. Leeches, bleeding, poultices of herbs. Nothing worked. He died two months ago."

"My sister," said another. "She was pregnant. The baby came early. They both died."

The third student was silent for a long time. Then: "I killed a man."

The room grew very still.

"He was my neighbor. He came to our door, coughing. My mother told me not to let him in. He begged. He said he just wanted water. I closed the door. I heard him coughing on the other side, then silence. In the morning, he was dead on our doorstep."

Guillaume looked at his hands. They were musician's hands, long-fingered, sensitive. They could feel the difference between gut strings and metal, could adjust the tension on a lute by touch alone. But they had never closed a door on a dying man.

"What do we do with this?" he asked.

No one answered.

He picked up his lute. The instrument was a new design, with more strings, a wider range. He had been working on a composition before the sickness came—a complex piece with multiple voices, interweaving melodies, mathematical precision.

Now he played something simpler. A single melody line, repeating, varying slightly each time. The notes filled the empty hall, bounced off the stone walls, came back changed by the encounter.

"Listen," he said. "The note decays. It hits the wall, loses some of itself, returns different. That's what's happening to us. We're being changed by what we hit against."

He played on. The melody became a dance tune, then a lament, then something in between. The students listened. One tapped his foot, then stopped, as if remembering this wasn't the time for rhythm.

After the lesson, Guillaume walked through the university grounds. The grass was growing tall in the quadrangles, untended. Weeds pushed through the cobblestones. A book lay open on a bench, its pages warped by rain.

He went to his study, a small room filled with manuscripts, instruments, half-finished compositions. On his desk lay the piece he had been working on—the "Messe de Nostre Dame." It was ambitious, revolutionary even. Polyphonic settings of the Mass ordinary, voices moving independently yet together, creating harmonies no one had attempted before.

He looked at the notes on the page. They were just marks, ink on parchment. But when sung, they became something else—prayer, mathematics, emotion all at once.

He picked up a quill, dipped it in ink. He began to write. Not the Mass, but something else. A virelai, a secular form, about love and loss. The words came in French, not Latin:

*Douce dame jolie,*
*Pour dieu ne pensés mie*
*Que nulle ait signorie*
*Seur moy fors vous seulement.*

Sweet lovely lady,
For God's sake don't think
That any has sovereignty
Over me except you alone.

He wrote through the afternoon, as the light faded. The poem was about courtly love, about a knight pining for his lady. But as he wrote, the words took on other meanings. The "lady" became life itself, fleeting, beautiful, cruel. The "knight" became every person trying to hold on to something that couldn't be held.

When he finished, he realized he was crying. Not sobbing, just tears running down his face, dripping onto the parchment, blurring the ink slightly. He didn't wipe them away.

He took the manuscript to the chapel. A single candle burned on the altar. He placed his new composition beside it, a offering to whatever was listening.

Outside, the bells began to ring for compline. Fewer bells than before—some of the bell-ringers had died—but the sound still carried, bronze vibrating in the evening air, sending waves through the city, through the sickness, through the grief.

**Scene Five: The Farm, Tuscany, 1400**

The olive trees were older than anyone living. Their trunks twisted like muscle, their branches reaching in directions that seemed deliberate, as if they were trying to grasp something just out of reach. Isabella walked between them, her hand brushing the rough bark.

Her grandfather had planted some of these trees. Her father had tended them. Now they were hers.

The plague had come and gone, returned and left again, like a tide. Each time it took more. Her entire family—parents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins. All gone. She was twenty-three, alone on land that should have supported twenty.

For a year, she did nothing. She let the fields go fallow, let the weeds grow, let the house gather dust. She ate what she could find—eggs from the chickens that survived, vegetables from the garden that grew wild, rabbits she trapped. She slept when tired, woke when light came through the shutters.

Then one morning, she woke with a thought: *The olives need pruning.*

It was such an ordinary thought, so practical, that it startled her. She hadn't thought about the future in months. But the thought persisted.

She found the pruning shears in the shed
