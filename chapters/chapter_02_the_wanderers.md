# Chapter 2: THE WANDERERS

## 1. The Leaving

The dust tasted of endings. Kaela felt it between her teeth, gritty and final, as she watched her brother bury the last of the summer seeds. The acacia trees stood skeletal against a sky bleached white by heat. For three dry seasons now, the game had grown scarce, the waterholes shrinking to mud-cracked circles where only the desperate drank.

Her father, Tor, returned from the high ridge with empty hands. The antelope herds had turned north, following rains that never came to their valley. He stood before the family circle—his wife Lina, their three living children, his mother who remembered the last great drought—and spoke the words they all feared.

"We follow the herds."

Lina's hands stilled on the grinding stone. The rhythmic scrape of rock against seed ceased, and in that silence, the decision settled like stone. Kaela's younger sister, Mara, began to cry—soft, hiccuping sobs that shook her small frame. Their grandmother placed a gnarled hand on the child's head.

"The land remembers us," the old woman said. "But the land is hungry too."

They took what could be carried: sleeping hides rolled tight, stone tools wrapped in leather, fire-making kits of dry grass and flint. Tor carried the ancestral spear, its shaft worn smooth by generations of hands. Lina carried the seed basket—not the summer seeds they'd saved, but the wild grains that grew along migration routes, the ones that needed no tending.

On the morning of departure, Kaela climbed the ridge one last time. Below, her family looked small against the red earth, their shadows stretching long in the dawn light. To the south lay the valley of her birth, the riverbed where she'd learned to swim, the cave where her first brother was buried. To the north stretched unknown lands, hazy with distance.

The Milky Way still hung in the western sky, a river of stars flowing toward the horizon they would follow. Kaela wondered if the ancestors watched from those cold lights, if they approved this leaving. She touched the ochre handprint on the rock beside her—her mother's mother's hand, placed there when the world was younger.

When she descended, her father was testing the weight of their packs. "The children first," he said. "Then the old. Then the strong."

They walked single file, Tor breaking trail. The dust rose in plumes behind them, marking their passage. By midday, the acacia groves disappeared behind a shimmer of heat. By evening, they found the first antelope track—fresh, pointing north.

That night, they made camp in a dry wash. Tor struck flint against pyrite until sparks caught in the tinder bundle. The fire bloomed small and precious against the gathering dark. Beyond its circle, hyenas called to one another, their laughter carrying across the plains.

Lina distributed strips of dried meat. Mara ate listlessly, her eyes fixed on the southern stars. "Will we come back?" she asked.

"When the rains return," Lina said, but her eyes met Tor's, and Kaela saw the truth there: they would not return. Not in their lifetimes.

The fire died to embers. One by one, they slept. Kaela lay awake listening to the wind through dry grass, a sound like whispering. She thought of the seeds in her mother's basket—each one a memory of place, a promise of elsewhere. They carried their home in their hands, in their bones, in the stories they would tell around future fires.

At dawn, they walked again. The land began to change—gentler slopes, different trees. Birds with unfamiliar calls watched from thorn bushes. Kaela felt the old world slipping away grain by grain, like sand through fingers.

## 2. The Ice

The cold arrived like a thief. First as a sharpness in the wind, then as frost whitening the grass at dawn, finally as snow that fell for three days without ceasing. They huddled in a limestone cave, the entrance partially blocked by a rockslide from some earlier age.

Inside, the world reduced to breath-clouds and shivering. Tor and Kaela ventured out each morning to hunt, returning with ice-encrusted beards and sometimes a hare or ptarmigan. The game grew scarcer as the white deepened.

Mara developed the cough first—a wet, rattling sound that echoed in the cave's hollow spaces. Then the fever. Lina brewed willow-bark tea, wrapped the child in every hide they possessed, sang the healing songs her mother had taught her. The songs did nothing.

On the seventh night of snow, Mara stopped breathing.

They buried her in the cave's deepest chamber, where the cold would preserve her small body. Lina placed a string of shell beads around her daughter's neck—beads carried from the southern lands, each shell a memory of warmer seas. Tor chipped a crude antelope shape from a piece of limestone, placed it in her hands.

"We should turn back," Lina said, her voice stripped raw by grief.

"Back to what?" Tor asked. "The drought killed the south. The cold kills here. At least here, there is movement."

Kaela watched her parents' faces in the firelight—the lines deepened by hunger and loss, the eyes holding stubborn embers of will. She thought of Mara's laughter, now silenced. Thought of the brother buried years earlier. Thought of the grandmother who had died on the trail two moons past.

The family was shrinking, like ice melting inward.

That night, the temperature dropped further. The fire guttered despite their careful tending. The wind found cracks in their rock shelter, whistling through like a spirit trying to enter. Kaela dreamed of warmth—of the sun on her back, of sweat trickling between her shoulder blades, of water that didn't need to be melted from ice.

She woke to her mother's hand on her shoulder. "Your brother," Lina whispered.

The boy, barely five summers, burned with fever. His breath came in shallow gasps. Kaela watched her father's face as he assessed the situation—the dwindling food, the deepening cold, the sick child. Saw the calculation happening behind his eyes.

"We go," Tor decided. "Now. While we still can."

They wrapped the boy in the warmest hides, fashioned a sled from branches and leather straps. Lina would pull while Tor broke trail through snow that reached their thighs. Kaela carried what remained of their supplies.

Outside, the world had turned monochrome—white ground, white sky, the trees black skeletons against the glare. The wind cut through their hides like stone blades. They walked into it, heads down, following a river valley that Tor hoped would lead to lower elevations.

For three days, they moved through a silent world. The only sounds were their own breathing, the crunch of snow underfoot, the occasional crack of ice from the frozen river. The boy drifted in and out of consciousness. When awake, he asked for water, for his sister, for home.

On the fourth day, they found the mammoth.

It lay at the base of a cliff, half-buried in snow, its great tusks curving toward the sky like pale moons. Wolves had been at the carcass, but much meat remained frozen solid. Tor approached cautiously, spear ready, but no predators challenged them.

For the first time in weeks, they ate until full. The rich fat, the dark meat—it felt like life returning. They built a proper fire from the dead mammoth's bones and what dry wood they could scavenge. The flames leaped high, casting dancing shadows on the snow.

That night, the boy's fever broke. He woke clear-eyed, asked for food. Lina wept as she fed him strips of mammoth meat.

They stayed by the carcass for five days, harvesting what they could carry. Tor worked methodically, removing hide, cutting meat into portable strips, cracking bones for marrow. Kaela helped render fat into containers made from the animal's own stomach.

On the morning they prepared to leave, Kaela climbed the cliff above the mammoth. From that height, she could see the river valley stretching north, the snow thinning in the distance, hints of green where the ice retreated. Further still, mountains rose blue and jagged against the horizon.

When she descended, her father was studying their direction. "The cold comes from there," he said, pointing north. "But the land rises that way." He pointed east. "Higher ground may be colder, but it may also be drier. Less snow."

They chose east.

As they left the mammoth behind, Kaela looked back at the great skeleton emerging from melting snow. Already ravens gathered, and she knew soon only bones would remain. But those bones would feed other creatures—foxes gnawing for marrow, mice nesting in rib cages, lichens growing on sun-bleached curves.

They carried the mammoth with them in their bellies, in their strength, in the stories taking shape around evening fires. The dead thing giving life to the living—this was the pattern of the world.

## 3. The Ice Wall

The world ended in a wall of blue. Not the clean blue of sky, but a bruised, ancient blue, veined with white and swallowing the horizon. Tor halted, the worn leather of his boots sinking into the gritty snow. Behind him, the ragged line of his family and the few others still following stopped as one. No one spoke. The wind did the talking—a low, constant moan that poured off the glacier's face, carrying a cold that felt less like temperature and more like a solid thing, scraping at exposed cheeks and stealing breath.

Lina moved to his side, her hand finding his elbow. Her touch was a faint warmth through layers of fur. "It goes on forever," she said, her voice flat. Not a question.

"Nothing is forever," Tor murmured, but the words felt hollow. They had followed the migrating caribou for weeks, only to see the herd's tracks vanish at the ice's base. The glacier was a cliff, soaring higher than any rock face they knew, its surface a chaos of shattered seracs and deep, shadowed crevasses. It hummed with a deep, inner cold.

"We turn back," said one of the others, a man named Bren. "Find the river valley again."

"The valley is hunted out," Tor said. "We knew that."

"And this is death." Bren gestured at the wall.

Around their small fire that night, the debate was a brittle thing. Kaela, their daughter, just past her twelfth winter, stared into the flames, her face pinched. "Vek says he saw a bird fly over the top," she whispered.

Vek, young, with restless eyes that missed nothing, nodded. "It came from the other side. There is another side."

The silence stretched. To go back meant slow starvation, dwindling hope. To go forward was a prayer to a frozen god.

At first light, Vek stood, tightening the thongs on his snowshoes. "I'll find a way. A day, maybe two. Wait here."

Lina pressed a pouch of dried meat into his hands. Her eyes were bright with a dread she wouldn't voice. Tor clasped his forearm. "The sun is your guide. Mark your path."

Vek grinned, a flash of white in his wind-reddened face, and turned into the wind.

The first day passed in a vigil of shivering. Kaela watched the ice until her eyes watered. The second day, the wind rose, hurling crystalline snow that hissed against the hides of their shelter. Tor climbed a rocky outcrop, squinting until his vision blurred, seeing only the relentless, sculpted blue.

By the third morning, the hope had curdled. The fire was ashes. Lina's face was a mask of settled grief. Kaela finally wept, soundless tears freezing on her lashes.

"He is gone into the ice," Bren said, not unkindly. "It kept him."

Tor looked from his daughter's shattered expression to the impossible wall. The cold had eaten Vek's promise, his footprints, his very memory from the air. To wait longer was to join him.

"We go," Tor said, the words ash in his mouth. "South, along its edge. We move."

As they gathered their pitiful bundles, Kaela looked back one last time. The glacier stood, indifferent, a monument to all the paths not taken, holding the boy with the restless eyes in its silent, blue heart. They turned their backs to it and walked, the wind pushing them on, as if even it had grown tired of their waiting.

## 4. The Others

The valley opened before them like a cupped hand—green with spring growth, watered by a river that ran clear over stones. They had descended from the high passes, leaving the worst of the cold behind. Here, willow and birch grew along the water, and the air smelled of damp earth and growing things.

Tor saw the smoke first—a thin gray thread rising from beyond a bend in the river. He raised a hand, and they froze. For a long moment, they watched. No movement. Just that steady plume against the sky.

"Others," Lina whispered.

They had heard stories of other people—different faces, strange tongues, sometimes hostile. Their own group numbered only three now: Tor, Lina, Kaela, and the boy still weak from illness. Not a fighting force.

Tor motioned them into the trees. They hid their packs, took only weapons. He would approach alone, show himself openly but armed. A display of strength without threat.

Kaela watched from cover as her father walked toward the smoke. He moved slowly, spear held vertical, making no attempt at stealth. The river murmured beside him. A kingfisher flashed blue over the water.

Then figures emerged from the trees across the river. Three men, armed with spears similar to Tor's. They stood watching, making no move to cross. Their skins were paler than Tor's, their hair lighter. They wore hides of animals Kaela didn't recognize.

Tor stopped at the water's edge. Raised an empty hand.

One of the strangers did the same.

For what felt like hours, they stood thus—two groups separated by flowing water, assessing. Then the lead stranger pointed upstream, made a walking motion with his fingers. Pointed to Tor, then to himself, then upstream again.

An invitation.

Tor nodded. He turned back toward the trees where his family hid, made a subtle gesture: follow, but stay hidden.

They moved parallel to the river, keeping to cover. The strangers did the same on their side. Upstream, the valley widened. The strangers' camp became visible—three low shelters of hide and branch, a central fire, women working hides, children playing with a dog.

The strangers crossed at a shallow ford. Tor met them there. More gestures—pointing to the sky, to the land, miming hunting, eating. The universal language of need.

Kaela watched from behind a screen of willow. She saw the moment when one of the strangers noticed their hidden position. His eyes met hers through the leaves. He didn't raise his weapon, just tilted his head in curiosity.

She stepped into the open.

The strangers' women came forward then. One held out a piece of dried meat. Another showed a basket of gathered roots. Lina emerged, holding out their own offering—a string of shell beads.

The trading began awkwardly, then with growing confidence. They shared food by the river. The strangers had red deer meat, mushrooms Kaela didn't recognize, a paste made from nuts. They had never seen shells from southern seas.

As evening approached, Tor made the decision. They would camp nearby but separate. A show of trust with caution.

That night, fires burned on both sides of the river. The strangers sang—a different scale, different rhythms, but the human voice nonetheless. Kaela lay awake listening to the unfamiliar melodies drift across the water.

In the morning, the strangers' leader—a man named Bor, as they learned through gestures—approached with a proposal. He pointed north, mimed many animals, then pointed to their two groups, mimed hunting together.

The mammoth herds were migrating through a pass three days north. Too many for one group to handle, but together...

They debated in hushed tones. "They could turn on us during the hunt," Lina said.

"They need us as much as we need them," Tor countered. "They have fewer hunters than we thought."

Kaela watched Bor's group. Saw the thinness of their children, the patches on their hides. Survival made allies of strangers.

They agreed.

For three days, they traveled together, a wary truce holding. They shared hunting techniques—the strangers used throwing sticks for birds, had developed a clever snare for hares. Tor showed them how to read wind direction for stalking.

On the fourth day, they found the mammoths—a herd of perhaps twenty, moving slowly through a broad valley. The plan formed through gesture and example: drive them toward the cliff, let the fall do the killing.

The hunt lasted all day. Chaos of thundering feet, trumpeting calls, dust rising in clouds. Kaela found herself beside one of the strangers' young men during the drive. They worked in unison, waving hides, shouting, turning a young mammoth away from escape.

When the animal went over the cliff, the roar that went up was from all throats, all languages. They swarmed the carcass together, began the butchering as one people.

That night, fires burned all around the kill site. They feasted together, the boundaries between groups blurring with shared labor, shared food. Bor's daughter—a girl near Kaela's age—showed her how to make cord from sinew. Kaela demonstrated fire-making with the drill method.

Tor and Bor sat apart, talking in the growing dark. Kaela watched them point at stars, trace routes on the ground with sticks. Making maps of possible futures.

When they parted two days later, it was with promises of meeting again when the seasons turned. They traded gifts—a fine spear point for a string of shells, knowledge of medicinal plants for hunting secrets.

As they walked away, Kaela looked back. Bor's people were breaking camp, loading sleds with mammoth meat. They would survive the coming winter because of this alliance. So would her family.

The violence that could have been had become something else—not friendship exactly, but recognition. Same needs, same fears, same stubborn will to continue.

## 5. The Last Neanderthal

Kho watched from the high limestone ledge, his breath a pale plume in the cold air. Below, along the river's edge, the new ones moved. They were taller, limbs like saplings, their voices a cascade of strange, complex sounds that carried up the rock face. They flowed into the valley with a terrifying purpose, their shelters rising from the ground like swift-growing mushrooms.

A profound loneliness, deeper than any cave, hollowed his chest. He was the last. He had smelled the lingering smoke of empty hearths for moons, had found the silent bodies of the last few—Ula, with her bad cough; Bron, who fell from the hunt. Their spirits were gone, absorbed by the cold stone. Now, only his own heartbeat echoed in the silence of his kind.

He shifted, the familiar ache in his brow ridge a constant companion. His world had narrowed to this: watching, and remembering.

A group of the newcomers clustered by the water, skinning a deer. Kho's eyes, adapted to pick out movement in the twilight under ancient trees, tracked them. Then he saw it. A child, perhaps four summers old, stumbled after a woman. The child's form was mostly like the others—longer legs, a smaller face. But there was a solidity to the small shoulders, a suggestion of robustness. And the eyes, set under a pronounced, familiar ridge of bone... Kho's breath caught.

He knew that brow. It was Bron's brow. It was his own, reflected in a still pool.

The genetic whisper of his people lived in this child of the invaders. The evidence was not in artifacts or hearths, but in flesh. Some of his kind had met these newcomers, not with spears, but with touch. A cautious exchange in a different valley, a silent acknowledgment in a shared cave for a season. The proof was walking below him, a living mosaic of two worlds.

The woman lifted the child, and for a moment, her gaze swept the cliffs. It passed over Kho's shadowed form. Did she sense him? The child, resting its head on her shoulder, looked directly at the ledge. Their eyes met across the distance—the deep-set, knowing eyes of the old earth meeting the bright, forward-looking eyes of the new.

No spear was raised. No cry was given. There was only the chill wind, the murmur of the river, and a look that spanned an epoch.

Kho slowly leaned back into the darkness of the crevice. The contact was made, not in words or trade, but in blood and bone. He was the last pure echo, but he was not the end. As the sounds of the new camp rose—laughter, a new kind of song—he turned and placed his broad hand against the limestone wall. He felt the pulse of the mountain, steady and old. Then he moved deeper into the cave, following the scent of damp stone and memory, leaving the future by the river to its own becoming.

## 6. The Crossing

The mountains rose before them like the bones of the earth exposed. Snow still clung to the highest peaks, though spring greened the lower slopes. This was the barrier every story warned of—the place where the world changed.

Tor studied the passes for three days before choosing. "There," he said, pointing to a notch where a waterfall cascaded down black rock. "Water means game. Game means passage."

They began the climb at dawn. The air grew thin, cold. Breathing became labor. The boy—they called him Finn now, after the river where he recovered—struggled with the altitude. They moved slowly, resting often.

Halfway up, they found the cave paintings.

A shallow overhang, protected from weather. On its walls, hands outlined in red ochre, animals Kaela recognized and some she didn't—creatures with great curved horns, cat-like shapes with protruding fangs. Beneath them, dots and lines that might be stars, might be journeys.

"Others passed this way," Lina said, touching a handprint. It fit neatly within her own, though the person who made it had lived generations earlier.

They camped in the overhang that night. Kaela lay awake studying the paintings by firelight. The artists had seen mammoths, aurochs, lions. Had they been heading east as her family was? Or west, returning? Did they survive their journey?

In the morning, they reached the pass. From that height, the world unfolded in a way Kaela had never imagined. Range upon range of mountains, valleys like green seams between them, rivers silver threads in the distance. And beyond, a vast plain stretching to the horizon.

"The other side," Tor breathed.

The descent proved harder than the climb. Loose scree shifted underfoot. They picked their way down carefully, sometimes sliding, sometimes climbing backward like crabs. Finn fell once, scraping his legs raw on stone. He didn't cry, just got up and kept going.

At the base, a new world awaited.

The trees were different—broader leaves, different bark. Birds with brilliant plumage flashed through the canopy. The air smelled of unfamiliar flowers, of resin from trees Kaela didn't know.

And the animals...

They saw their first horse—a small, sturdy creature with a dark stripe down its back, grazing in a meadow. It raised its head, watched them with dark, intelligent eyes, then trotted away.

They saw the giant deer next—antlers spanning twice a man's height, moving through birch forest like living shadows. Tor gripped his spear, but the deer showed no aggression, only curiosity.

The river they followed grew wider, faster. Its waters ran milky with glacial silt. Fish leaped at twilight, silver flashes in the dim light. Kaela learned to catch them with her hands in shallow pools, a skill born of necessity.

One afternoon, they rounded a bend and froze.

On the opposite bank stood creatures from some other age—shaggy coats, long curved tusks, small ears. Woolly rhinoceroses. Two adults and a calf, drinking at the water's edge. They were massive, armored in hair and horn.

The family retreated silently into the trees. They watched as the rhinos finished drinking, the calf nudging its mother's side. The adults moved with surprising grace for their size, a rolling gait that shook the ground.

That night, Tor drew maps in the dirt by firelight. "We are here," he said, making a mark. "The mountains behind. The plain ahead. The river will lead us to lower lands, warmer lands."

"But what lives there?" Lina asked.

"What always lives," Tor said. "Things that eat. Things that are eaten. Things trying to survive."

They followed the river for days. The valley widened, the mountains receding to blue humps on the horizon. The forest gave way to grassland, endless waves of grass moving in the wind like a breathing thing.

Here they encountered the aurochs—great wild cattle, black with forward-curving horns. Herds of hundreds moving across the plain, their passage sounding like distant thunder. They gave the herds wide berth, knowing the bulls could be aggressive.

Kaela began to notice patterns. The game trails converged at watering holes. Certain plants grew only near water, others on higher ground. Birds gathered where insects swarmed. The land spoke to those who learned to listen.

Seasons turned. The family moved with them, following game, following water, following the ancient rhythms that had guided their kind since the first leaving. They learned this new land as they had learned the old—through trial, through loss, through the slow accumulation of knowledge passed from parent to child.

One evening, as the sun sank red into the western grass, Kaela climbed a low hill and looked back the way they had come. The mountains were distant now, barely visible on the horizon. Somewhere beyond them lay the valley of her birth, the acacia trees, the ochre handprint on the ridge.

She was no longer the girl who had touched that handprint. The journey had changed her—hardened her hands, sharpened her eyes, deepened her understanding of what it meant to be human in a world that did not care if humans survived.

But they had survived. They would continue to survive. And one day, her children would climb a different hill, look back at a different horizon, and wonder about the grandmother who had walked so far.

The stars emerged one by one. Kaela found the Milky Way, that river of light she had followed since the beginning. It stretched from horizon to horizon, unchanged by all the miles beneath her feet.

She descended the hill and returned to the fire, to her family, to the warmth of voices in the gathering dark. Tomorrow they would walk again. Tomorrow and tomorrow, until walking became staying, and staying became home.

But that was a story for another generation to tell.
