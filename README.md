## The Story

*"We were unfinished. A bridge between animal and divine. We burned ourselves up trying to cross it."*

Humanity's last project: encode everything we were into a message for non-terrestrial intelligence. Not a boast. Not an apology. Just a witness.

Told through the hands of ordinary builders—cave painters, plague survivors, trench soldiers, code breakers, astronauts, archivists—this chronicle traces 40,000 years of human civilization from the first handprint to the final transmission.

Five acts. Eighteen chapters. One species trying to explain itself to the universe.
